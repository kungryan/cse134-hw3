                    When I was younger, I messed around with making websites with really basic HTML without putting too much
                    thought into anything I was doing. Now that I've more been more formally introduced into the HTML, I am excited to
                    experiment and figure out what all these tags do and there is frankly <em>a lot</em>. For now, I've set up just the HTML.
                    I've planned my site around this wireframe:
                </p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="images/wireframe_wide.png" width="1080" height="270" media="(min-width: 1080px)">
                    <img src="images/wireframe_tall.png" width="380" height="1091" alt="Website's Wireframe">
                </picture>
                <p>When working on this project, I looked at a few websites from a few people whose work I admire and seeing what they did with their personal websites.</p>
                <iframe
                    title="Hank Green's Website"
                    src="https://hankgreen.com/"
                    width="640"
                    height="360"

                </iframe>
                <p> 
                    I personally really like the structuring of <cite><a href="https://hankgreen.com/">Hank Green's website</a></cite>
                    and I like the composition of her projects in <cite><a href="http://lena.fyi/">Lena Raine's website</a></cite>
                    I want to have some basic dark and light mode styles while also having my own custom
                    fun styles that reflect who I am a bit more. I am big into video games so one such idea could be having various click sound effects
                    that might be related to the themes.
